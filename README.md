# RSA-Rivest-Shamir-Adleman-
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a cryptographic algorithm that uses two keys: a public key, known to everyone, and a private key, kept secret. The public key is used for encrypting data or verifying digital signatures, while the private key is used for decrypting data or creating digital signatures.

In RSA, key generation involves selecting large prime numbers, computing their product to create a modulus n, and then choosing numbers e and d such that e is used with n to encrypt messages, andùëë d is used to decrypt them. RSA is widely used for secure communication, digital signatures (which ensure data authenticity), and key exchange in applications where data security is critical. Its security is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, making it resilient against brute-force attacks.
